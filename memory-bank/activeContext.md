## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-Page Application**
   - Decision: Use React for a single-page application approach
   - Rationale: Provides a seamless user experience with client-side routing
   - Consideration: Ensure initial load performance is optimized

2. **RESTful API Design**
   - Decision: Implement a RESTful API with Express
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, scalable architecture
   - Consideration: Consistent API design patterns across endpoints

3. **SQLite Database**
   - Decision: Use SQLite for data storage
   - Rationale: Simplicity, portability, and suitable for expected user load
   - Consideration: Migration path to PostgreSQL if needed for larger deployments

### UI/UX Considerations

1. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Decision: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for equipment layout
   - Rationale: Intuitive way to arrange equipment to match physical layout
   - Consideration: Performance with large numbers of equipment items

2. **Reservation Interface**
   - Decision: Use a time-slot based selection interface
   - Rationale: Clear visual representation of available and booked times
   - Consideration: Mobile-friendly interaction for touch devices

3. **Navigation Structure**
   - Decision: Use a sidebar navigation with clear section indicators
   - Rationale: Provides easy access to all main features
   - Consideration: Responsive design for different screen sizes

4. **Internationalization**
   - Decision: Implement a translation system using a utility function and JSON-based translation files
   - Rationale: Support for multiple languages enhances accessibility and user experience
   - Consideration: Ensure all user-facing text is properly internationalized

### Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**
   - Decision: Use JWT for authentication
   - Rationale: Stateless authentication suitable for the application
   - Consideration: Token expiration and refresh strategy

2. **State Management**
   - Decision: Use React Context API for global state
   - Rationale: Built-in solution sufficient for application complexity
   - Consideration: Performance optimization for state updates

3. **Data Fetching Strategy**
   - Decision: Use SWR for data fetching and caching
   - Rationale: Provides optimistic updates and caching
   - Consideration: Offline support and error handling

## Current Challenges

1. **Equipment Layout Persistence**
   - Challenge: Efficiently storing and retrieving equipment layout information
   - Approach: Implemented a flexible database schema for position data with text labels support
   - Next steps: Optimize performance for layouts with many equipment items

2. **Reservation Conflict Prevention**
   - Challenge: Ensuring no double-bookings occur
   - Approach: Implemented server-side validation with transaction support
   - Next steps: Enhance the conflict detection algorithm with more user-friendly feedback

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Challenge: Keeping reservation status current across users
   - Approach: Currently using polling approach for updates
   - Next steps: Evaluate WebSocket implementation for more efficient real-time updates

4. **User Experience Consistency**
   - Challenge: Ensuring intuitive experience across different screens
   - Approach: Developed consistent UI components and interaction patterns
   - Next steps: Create design system documentation and standardize component styling

5. **Internationalization Completion**
   - Challenge: Ensuring all user-facing text is properly internationalized
   - Approach: Created a centralized translation system with utility functions
   - Next steps: Complete translation coverage for all components and add support for additional languages
