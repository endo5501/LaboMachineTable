# Active Context: NcReserve

## Current Focus

The NcReserve project has progressed from the initial planning phase to the implementation phase. The basic application structure is now in place and functional. We are currently:

1. Implementing the core functionality of the laboratory equipment reservation system
2. Testing and refining the user interface and experience
3. Ensuring proper integration between frontend and backend components
4. Addressing any issues that arise during development
5. Implementing internationalization support for the application

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-Page Application**
   - Decision: Use React for a single-page application approach
   - Rationale: Provides a seamless user experience with client-side routing
   - Consideration: Ensure initial load performance is optimized

2. **RESTful API Design**
   - Decision: Implement a RESTful API with Express
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, scalable architecture
   - Consideration: Consistent API design patterns across endpoints

3. **SQLite Database**
   - Decision: Use SQLite for data storage
   - Rationale: Simplicity, portability, and suitable for expected user load
   - Consideration: Migration path to PostgreSQL if needed for larger deployments

### UI/UX Considerations

1. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Decision: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for equipment layout
   - Rationale: Intuitive way to arrange equipment to match physical layout
   - Consideration: Performance with large numbers of equipment items

2. **Reservation Interface**
   - Decision: Use a time-slot based selection interface
   - Rationale: Clear visual representation of available and booked times
   - Consideration: Mobile-friendly interaction for touch devices

3. **Navigation Structure**
   - Decision: Use a sidebar navigation with clear section indicators
   - Rationale: Provides easy access to all main features
   - Consideration: Responsive design for different screen sizes

4. **Internationalization**
   - Decision: Implement a translation system using a utility function and JSON-based translation files
   - Rationale: Support for multiple languages enhances accessibility and user experience
   - Consideration: Ensure all user-facing text is properly internationalized

### Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**
   - Decision: Use JWT for authentication
   - Rationale: Stateless authentication suitable for the application
   - Consideration: Token expiration and refresh strategy

2. **State Management**
   - Decision: Use React Context API for global state
   - Rationale: Built-in solution sufficient for application complexity
   - Consideration: Performance optimization for state updates

3. **Data Fetching Strategy**
   - Decision: Use SWR for data fetching and caching
   - Rationale: Provides optimistic updates and caching
   - Consideration: Offline support and error handling

## Current Challenges

1. **Equipment Layout Persistence**
   - Challenge: Efficiently storing and retrieving equipment layout information
   - Approach: Design a flexible database schema for position data
   - Next steps: Research optimal data structure for 2D positioning

2. **Reservation Conflict Prevention**
   - Challenge: Ensuring no double-bookings occur
   - Approach: Implement server-side validation with transaction support
   - Next steps: Design conflict detection algorithm

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Challenge: Keeping reservation status current across users
   - Approach: Implement polling or WebSocket for updates
   - Next steps: Evaluate trade-offs between approaches

4. **User Experience Consistency**
   - Challenge: Ensuring intuitive experience across different screens
   - Approach: Develop consistent UI components and interaction patterns
   - Next steps: Create design system documentation

5. **Internationalization Implementation**
   - Challenge: Ensuring all user-facing text is properly internationalized
   - Approach: Create a centralized translation system with utility functions
   - Next steps: Complete translation files for all supported languages and integrate throughout the application

## Team Communication

- Regular project status updates will be documented in the memory bank
- Key decisions will be recorded with rationale and considerations
- Technical challenges and solutions will be documented for knowledge sharing
