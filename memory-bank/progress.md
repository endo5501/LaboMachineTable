## Known Issues

As the project has advanced in the implementation phase, we have encountered and addressed several issues:

1. **Port Conflict Issue**
   - Issue: Server port 5000 was already in use by another system process (AirPlay on Mac)
   - Status: Resolved
   - Solution: 
     - Configured server to use port 5001 in server/.env
     - Enhanced environment variable configuration with NODE_ENV and JWT_SECRET
     - Made client-server connection configurable through environment variables
     - Implemented setupProxy.js to dynamically set API URL based on environment
     - Added client/.env.development and client/.env.production for environment-specific settings
     - Updated server.js to use port 5001 as the default fallback port (instead of 5000) to avoid conflicts with AirPlay even when .env file is not present

2. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Issue: Performance with large numbers of equipment items
   - Status: Implemented with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Mitigation: Monitoring performance and considering virtualization techniques for rendering if needed

3. **Reservation Conflict Detection**
   - Issue: Potential race conditions in concurrent reservations
   - Status: Implemented server-side validation
   - Current implementation: ReservationWindow component checks for existing reservations and prevents selection of already reserved time slots
   - Next Steps: Enhance with more user-friendly feedback and optimistic locking

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Issue: Keeping all clients in sync with reservation changes
   - Status: Currently using polling approach
   - Implementation: ReservationStatusPage has a refresh button to manually update the reservation data
   - Next Steps: Evaluate WebSocket implementation for more efficient real-time updates

5. **Internationalization Coverage**
   - Issue: Ensuring all user-facing text is properly internationalized
   - Status: Core translation infrastructure implemented with translations.js and translate.js
   - Current status: ReservationStatusPage uses translation, but ReservationWindow component still needs internationalization
   - Next Steps: Complete translation coverage for all components, particularly the ReservationWindow component

6. **Text Label Positioning**
   - Issue: Ensuring text labels don't overlap with equipment in layout
   - Status: Basic implementation complete
   - Next Steps: Add collision detection and automatic positioning suggestions

7. **Reservation Date Handling**
   - Issue: Ensuring proper date handling for reservations across different timezones
   - Status: Basic implementation using date-fns library
   - Current implementation: ReservationStatusPage allows date selection for viewing reservations
   - Next Steps: Enhance date handling to account for timezone differences

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Technical complexity of equipment layout | Medium | Medium | Early prototyping and testing |
| Performance issues with reservation system | Low | High | Implement efficient database queries and indexing |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | High | Focus on intuitive UI/UX and user documentation |
| Integration issues between frontend and backend | Medium | Medium | Clear API contracts and comprehensive testing |

## Continuous Improvement

As development progresses, we will:

1. Regularly update this progress document
2. Conduct code reviews to maintain quality
3. Refine requirements based on feedback
4. Address technical debt proactively
5. Document lessons learned for future reference
