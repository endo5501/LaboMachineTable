## Known Issues

As the project has moved into the implementation phase, we have encountered and addressed some issues:

1. **Port Conflict Issue**
   - Issue: Server port 5000 was already in use by another system process
   - Status: Resolved
   - Solution: Configured server to use port 5001 and updated client proxy configuration

2. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Issue: Performance with large numbers of equipment items
   - Status: Monitoring
   - Mitigation: Consider virtualization techniques for rendering if performance degrades

3. **Reservation Conflict Detection**
   - Issue: Potential race conditions in concurrent reservations
   - Status: Implemented basic validation
   - Next Steps: Enhance with database transactions and optimistic locking

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Issue: Keeping all clients in sync with reservation changes
   - Status: Currently using polling approach
   - Next Steps: Evaluate WebSocket implementation for more efficient updates

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Technical complexity of equipment layout | Medium | Medium | Early prototyping and testing |
| Performance issues with reservation system | Low | High | Implement efficient database queries and indexing |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | High | Focus on intuitive UI/UX and user documentation |
| Integration issues between frontend and backend | Medium | Medium | Clear API contracts and comprehensive testing |

## Continuous Improvement

As development progresses, we will:

1. Regularly update this progress document
2. Conduct code reviews to maintain quality
3. Refine requirements based on feedback
4. Address technical debt proactively
5. Document lessons learned for future reference
