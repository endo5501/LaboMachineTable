## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, we have identified potential challenges:

1. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Potential Issue: Performance with large numbers of equipment items
   - Status: To be addressed during implementation
   - Mitigation: Consider virtualization techniques for rendering

2. **Reservation Conflict Detection**
   - Potential Issue: Race conditions in concurrent reservations
   - Status: To be addressed during implementation
   - Mitigation: Implement database transactions and optimistic locking

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Potential Issue: Keeping all clients in sync with reservation changes
   - Status: To be addressed during implementation
   - Mitigation: Evaluate WebSocket vs. polling approaches

3. **Core Frontend Implementation**
   - Target Completion: Mid May 2025
   - Success Criteria: Functional login, equipment management, and user management screens

4. **Reservation System Implementation**
   - Target Completion: Early June 2025
   - Success Criteria: Working reservation creation, modification, and conflict prevention

5. **Equipment Layout Visualization**
   - Target Completion: Mid June 2025
   - Success Criteria: Functional equipment layout editor and visualization

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Technical complexity of equipment layout | Medium | Medium | Early prototyping and testing |
| Performance issues with reservation system | Low | High | Implement efficient database queries and indexing |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | High | Focus on intuitive UI/UX and user documentation |
| Integration issues between frontend and backend | Medium | Medium | Clear API contracts and comprehensive testing |

## Continuous Improvement

As development progresses, we will:

1. Regularly update this progress document
2. Conduct code reviews to maintain quality
3. Refine requirements based on feedback
4. Address technical debt proactively
5. Document lessons learned for future reference
